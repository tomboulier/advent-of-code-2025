This is a playground for my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com).

## Languages

- Python (primary)
- Rust and other languages (maybe)

## Structure

Each day has its own directory:
- `day01/` - Day 1 solutions
- `day02/` - Day 2 solutions
- etc.

## Running Solutions

Navigate to the specific day directory and run the Python solution:

```bash
cd day01
python solution.py
```
